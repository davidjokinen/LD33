My Ludum Dare 33 game code. 

You are in charge of a space drug lab. Spot and get rid of fires and leave on a pod when you get enough cash. But the space station is crappy and fires randomly break out and doors randomly open. Also you need to keep track of the oxygen levels. Too much oxygen and fire spread faster. Too little and you will die. Remember to charge you fire extinguisher when it empties. Also note you lose money when a person dies but you gain money if you collect the remains. 

controls: 
WASD : to move 
E : Interact with stuff 
Space : to use extinguisher 
V : to change view
